# This is the New Changelog Testing

Here is going to be tested the new rules from the [commitlint-config-conventional (based on the the Angular convention)](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-conventional#type-enum)

- [This is the New Changelog Testing](#this-is-the-new-changelog-testing)
  - [Types](#types)

## Types

The new types proposed must be one of the following from [rb-conventional-changelog](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rb-conventional-changelog#type):

- feat: A new feature.
- fix: A bug fix.
- docs: Documentation only changes.
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc).
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature.
- perf: A code change that improves performance.
- test: Adding missing tests.
- chore: Changes to the build process (grunt) or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation and linters (jshint, etc.)
